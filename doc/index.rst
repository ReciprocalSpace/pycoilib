Pycoilib
========

Pycoilib is a free python library for inductance calculation

Look how easy it is to use: ::

    import pycoilib 
    # Get your stuff done 
    project.do_stuff() 

Features
--------

- Construct complex coil geometries from simple segments shapes : lines, arcs and loops
- Perform self-inductance computations for a coil and mutual inductance between coils
- Interface with magpylib to compute and display magnetic field maps


Installation
------------
As this library is still in development
